    "IMPORTANT TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS TO KNOW: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Associated Press Most Valuable Player Award (NFL AP MVP): This is an annual award presented by the Associated Press to a player in the National Football League judged to have been the most valuable in that year's regular season (distinct from the superbowl MVP, the most valuable player in the superbowl).\n",
    "2. Quarterback: A player positioned behind the ball before a play starts who directs a team's offensive play. This usually involves throwing the ball to a teammate down the field, but can also involve holding onto the ball and running it down the field if no teammates are open. \n",
    "3. Running Back: An offensive player who specializes in running the ball down the field, distinct from quarterbacks who usually throw the ball, and wide receivers who usually catch the ball. In rare cases, running backs have won the NFL AP MVP award, although this has only happened 4 times since 2000. Since this study is based on factors that influence a quarterback being selected as MVP, we will disregard running backs who won the MVP award for their year and only pay attention to the top 3 quarterbacks from that year. \n",
    "4. Offensive Line: A group of players on the quarterbacks team who shield him from the other team's defense, giving him adequate time to throw the ball down the field. A strong offensive line can greatly increase a quarterbacks performance, although we want to measure the extent to which this is true. \n",
    "5. Sack: Occurs when the defense tackles the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before they can throw a forward pass, or forces them out of bounds behind that line. It results in a loss of yardage for the offense and is a major defensive play that shifts momentum. \n",
    "6. Touchdown: The primary scoring play in American football, worth 6 points. It occurs when a player legally gains possession of the ball in the opponent's end zone, either by carrying it across the goal line or catching a pass while in the end zone.\n",
    "7. Field Goal: A 3-point scoring play, usually attempted on fourth down when the offense is close enough to the opponent's end zone but unable to score a touchdown. A kicker must place-kick or drop-kick the ball through the opponent's goalposts, passing above the crossbar and between the uprights. \n",
    "8. Downs: A down in American football is one of four permitted attempts (plays) for the offense to advance the ball at least 10 yards toward the opponent’s end zone. If the team gains 10 or more yards, they earn a new set of four downs (a \"first down\"). Failing to gain 10 yards in four downs results in a turnover where the other team receives the ball. \n",
    "9. Points Allowed Per Game: Points Allowed per Game (PA/G) in football is a defensive statistic representing the average number of points a team's defense surrenders to opponents per game over a specific period, calculated as Total Points Allowed / Games Played. It measures defensive efficiency, with lower averages indicating a stronger defense. \n",
    "10. Interception: A defensive play in American football where a defender catches a forward pass intended for an offensive receiver, resulting in an immediate turnover. It stops the offense's drive, awards the defense possession, and allows the defender to return the ball for potential yards or a touchdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "The National Football League, known in short as the NFL, is the premier sports league that plays the sport known as gridiron football or American football. It is the most popular sport in the United States by a large margin, and drew average viewership of 18.7 million viewers per game in the 2025 NFL Season.<a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-1) The sport is played on a 100 yard field with two teams pitted against each other, with the winner being the team whose score is highest after four 15 minute quarters have passed. One side, the offense, carriers the football and aims to make it into the opposing teams endzone to score points whether that is through field goals or touchdowns. The other side, the defense, does everything possible to stop or reverse the advancements of the offense. Among the various accolades and awards that are given in the NFL, only two remain at the top of every players list. The Super Bowl trophy itself, given to the champions of the football league, and the NFL Associated Press Most Valuable Player Award (abbreviated to NFL AP MVP). The latter is of most interest to us, as it has become a topic of much controversy following recent NFL seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NFL Associated Press Most Valuable Player Award is the most prestigious individual honor in professional American football, recognizing the player who provided the highest value to their team's success during the regular season. Voted on by a 50-person media panel, it highlights exceptional performance, usually for a top-performing quarterback on a winning team, and serves as a major accolade during the annual NFL Honors ceremony. However, this award is subject to a lot of controversy as many raise questions if the performance of the team surrounding MVP candidates is indirectly more valuable in the selection process than the skill of the player selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2025 NFL AP MVP race between Matthew Stafford (QB Rams) and Drake Maye (QB Patriots) already has many individuals racing to find different variables that affect MVP selection. One of these variables is the strength of schedule, a statistic that is determined by summing the win-loss records (or winning percentages) of all of a team's opponents from the previous season. Patriots have the 3rd easiest strength of schedule, while the Rams have tied for the 18th strength of schedule. While it's worth noting that Stafford did in fact receive the most recent MVP award, previous MVP winners have faced very easy teams such as four time MVP Aaron Rodgers with the Green Bay Packers.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor that is critical to the performance of previous MVP winners is the strength of the offensive line. The offensive line is composed of five players whose responsibility is to always protect the quarterback from defensive pressures and sacks. These players are: center, left guard, left tackle, right guard, and right tackle. A successful offensive line ensures that the pocket does not falter, preventing pressures and sacks that would hurt offensive progress made by either quarterback or running back.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "An overlooked statistic in MVP odds is defensive performance.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) On the surface, the defense of a team might not account for much in the way of offense. However, a good defense can stop a team short and force a punt that places the offense much closer to the endzone than expected. As a result, the defense is a critical component of the success of an offense, and by extension the MVP candidate. A strong defense is able to turn the ball over to the offense, giving more opportunities for the offense to score with elaborate plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what makes our project different from the ones that came before? The main factor of this project that differentiates us boils down to the variables we are paying attention to. Unlike previous projects which have explored the correlation between NFL MVP selection odds and metrics that evaluate quarterback performance (like touchdown points thrown), all the variables we listed above (strength of schedule, offensive line strength, and defensive performance) are not directly tied to quarterbacks. However, these variables are still known to influence quarterback performances, and by extension, their odds of being selected as MVP candidates. In this project, we plan to document the role team performance plays in the NFL MVP candidate selection process, despite the award only going to a single individual.\n",

   "source": [
    "Among the top three NFL MVP candidates who happen to be quarterbacks each year since 2000, lower offensive line pressure and sack rates (measured by percentage of sacks per play), an easier strength of schedule (measured by win percentages of opposing teams last season), and lower points allowed per game by team defenses (measured by average points allowed per game during a season) will be associated with a higher regular-season MVP vote share. This hypothesis is based on prior research suggesting that quarterback performance is influenced by team factors such as pass protection and defensive support, which can inflate traditional performance metrics. For example, a strong offensive line that minimizes sack rates on the quarterback gives the quarterback more time to make good throws, an easier strength of schedule allows the quarterback to accumulate better stats by playing against weaker defenses, and a strong team defense will strip the ball from the opposing offense to give the quarterback more play time. Since MVP voting often reflects both individual performance and team success, quarterback MVP candidates benefiting from an all around good team are expected to receive a greater share of MVP votes."

    "      - The dataset only includes players who received MVP votes, excluding the majority of quarterbacks each season. This creates selection bias and limits analysis to MVP candidates rather than all quarterbacks.\n",
    "      - MVP voting is subjective and influenced by media narratives, team success, and public perception, meaning vote share does not reflect performance metrics alone.\n",
    "      - The relatively small sample size (87 quarterback-season observations) limits the complexity of regression models that can be applied.\n",
    "      - Beginning with the 2022 season, MVP voting changed from a single-choice ballot to a ranked-choice system (voters rank their top five players), which affects how vote share is distributed across candidates compared to earlier seasons.\n",

    "### MVP Winners by Year \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset from Pro-Football-Reference documents winners of the Associated Press (AP) NFL Most Valuable Player Award, given annually to the player judged most valuable in the National Football League. Each row represents a single NFL season, making the primary unit of analysis the year. The key variables include the season (Year), the player’s name, position (such as QB for quarterback or RB for running back), team, and a link to detailed voting results. Because the award is decided by media voting, the dataset captures both performance recognition and historical context rather than raw game statistics alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important metrics associated with this dataset relate to voting outcomes. Voting data typically includes total vote points, number of first-place votes, and vote share (the percentage of possible votes received). These are measured in counts (number of votes) and percentages (vote share). A higher vote share indicates a stronger consensus among voters that a player was the most valuable that season. While the main table lists only winners, the linked voting pages provide additional context about how dominant a player’s season was relative to other candidates. For example, players such as Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers have won multiple MVP awards, suggesting sustained high-level performance across several seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some potential limitations to consider when analyzing this dataset. First, the MVP award is based on subjective voting rather than a purely objective formula, which introduces potential bias. Media narratives, team success, popularity, and positional importance may influence outcomes. Second, the dataset only lists winners in the main table, which can obscure close races or strong performances by runners-up unless additional voting pages are consulted. Third, historical comparisons across eras may be difficult because the NFL has evolved significantly over time. Rule changes, season length, and offensive styles have all shifted, making raw statistical comparisons imperfect. Finally, because the dataset focuses solely on award outcomes, it does not capture the full distribution of player performance across the league, limiting its usefulness for comprehensive statistical modeling without additional supplemental data.\n",

    "### NFL Standings and Team Stats \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset aggregates a wide range of team and league-level data for the 2025 National Football League season, making it valuable for analyzing team performance and trends across the league. At its core, the dataset includes standings and basic team statistics, with key metrics like Wins (W), Losses (L), Ties (T), and Winning Percentage (W-L%) that measure how each team performed over the regular season. It also shows Points For (PF) and Points Against (PA), which are the total points a team scored and allowed. These are measured in simple unit counts of points scored during games. Other derived metrics include Point Differential (PD), which is PF minus PA and gives a sense of overall team dominance, and Strength of Record (SoS) or Simple Rating System (SRS), advanced measures that adjust performance for schedule difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond standings, the page links to a host of offensive and defensive statistical categories, including passing, rushing, scoring, and special teams. For example, individual leaders in passing yards help indicate which players contributed most in the air, while team totals for passing yards, rushing yards, points scored, and total yards reveal offensive profiles across the league. Passing yards are counted in yards gained through completed throws, while rushing yards count ground gains. Both are measured in units of yards gained. Points scored encompasses all scoring methods (touchdowns, field goals, extra points) and is presented in total point units, offering a snapshot of offensive effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the dataset is comprehensive, there are some limitations to keep in mind. First, the page aggregates a very broad set of metrics but does not always show game-level or situation-specific nuances (like performance in clutch situations or under certain conditions). This could mask variability that’s important in deeper analytics. Second, some advanced metrics rely on derived formulas or assumptions (like SRS or Strength of Schedule), which can incorporate model bias or might not reflect real competitive balance perfectly. Third, because this view is a season summary, it cannot capture mid-season changes (such as injuries, trades, or coaching changes) without drilling down into game-by-game tables. Finally, the dataset is retrospective. It reflects the end results of a season, but doesn’t directly explain why certain teams performed the way they did, especially since many contributing factors (like in-game decision making or individual player context) aren’t encoded.\n",

    "The dataset contains the NFL Opposition and Defensive Statistics of each team by season. Each row represents a single NFL team in one season (observation = 830 rows, 29 variables). The important variables include Points Allowed (PA), which represents the total number of points the defensive team gives up against the offensive line, Yards Allowed (Yds), which measures the total yards the opponents gains, Yards per Play Allowed (Y/P), which refers to how many yards per play the opponents gains. A few more important variables are Interceptions (Int), Touchdowns (TD), Sacks (Sk), and Tackles for Loss (TFL) where a large amount of values are season counts whereas a few are efficiency percentages (Int%, TD%).\n",

In this project, PA and defensive statistics are relevant because a stronger team's defenses results beneficial towards MVP quarterbacks by allowing them better field positions and higher offensive opportunities. \n",
